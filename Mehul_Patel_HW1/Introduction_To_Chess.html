         <p>
            Setting up the pieces in the right places is important. The rooks occupies the corner squares. Right next to the rooks are the knights. 
			The bishop takes the other square next to the knight. 
			The queen is always placed on her color (white queen on white square), and the king is placed next to her.
			Your eight pawns occupy the next row up, all in a straight line. 
			Your opponentâ€™s pieces should in the same positions as yours, including the queen. 
         </p>

         <p>White always moves first in order to start the game. 
		 Any pawn or a knight may move but the strongest initial moves are the ones that control the center of the board. 
		 Because the other pieces are blocked by the pawns, they may not move yet you will see in our <a href="Pieces_Moves.html">Pieces Moves</a>.
