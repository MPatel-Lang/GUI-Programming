         <p><li>
           The king is the most important piece because you will lose the game when he is attacked and can't get to safety. 
		   This is called checkmate, and this is how the game is decided.</li></p>
		  <p><li> The queen is the most powerful piece because it can move in any straight-line direction: vertically, horizontally, or diagonally and can move in any number of squares. </li></p>
		  <p><li> You have two rooks; each one starts on a corner square. It may move vertically or horizontally through any unoccupied square. 
		   FYI, Castling is when the king is moved two squares toward the rook, and the rook moves past the king to the square right next to where the king has moved.</li></p>
		   <p><li>The two bishops are on a light square and a dark square. Like a rook, a bishop may move through any unoccupied square, but each one moves only diagonally.</li></p>
		   <p><li>The knight has the ability to move in two directions at once. This piece moves in an L-shaped pattern (two squares in one direction and then one square in a different direction).</li></p>
		   <p><li>A pawn can only move forward unless it is trying to capture an enemy piece, which it does by moving diagonally one square to the left or the right.
		   Once the pawn gets to the other side of board to the final rank when it can that be promoted to any other piece besides a king and 
		   it would be redundent and useless to keep it as a pawn.
